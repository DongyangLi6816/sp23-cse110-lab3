        <p>
            <img src = "Magic8ball.jpg" alt ="Magic 8 Ball"/>
            <ul>
                <li>Will create some form of a Magic 8 Ball (can be creative with it just sticking to the rough idea of something that predicts fortunes like a Magic 8 Ball)</li>
                <li>Week 3 is for Prototyping and getting a rough version produced</li>
                <li>Aim to experiment with it through any resources, including Chat GPT, to develop and interesting app</li>
                <li>Prototypes need to be functional</li>
                <li>There will be points for creativity, with the top 5 groups getting prizes</li>
                <li>Avoid using React, just focus on HTML and CSS so everyone can contribute without much prior knowledge</li>

        <h2>Things to consider</h2>
        <p>
            Our next steps are going to be to schedule our first meeting to we can hit the ground running and tackle the assignments we have due on Friday. Make sure the When2Meet is filled out and we can try to organize something as soon as possible to avoid scrambling towards the due date. Ideally, I think a good target would be to get ourselves together and have some substantial work done before Wednesday.
